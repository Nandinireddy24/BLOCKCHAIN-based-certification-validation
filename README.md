# Blockchain-based-certificate-validation

In the digital world, each and everything is digitalized in which the certificate of SSLC, HSC, and academic certificate are digitalized in the educational institution and provided to the students. Students are difficult to maintain their degree certificates. For the organization and institution, verification and validation of certificates are tedious and cumbersome. Our project will help to store the certificate in the blockchain system and provide security. First, the paper certificates are converted into digital certificates. The chaotic algorithm is used to generate the hash code value for the certificate. Then the certificates are store in blockchain. And these certificates are validated by using the mobile application. By using blockchain technology we can provide a more secure and efficient digital certificate validation.
